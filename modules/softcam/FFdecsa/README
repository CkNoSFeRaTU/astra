FFdecsa is a fast implementation of a CSA decryption algorithm for MPEG
TS packets. It is shockingly fast, more than 800% the speed of the
fastest implementation I can find around. (read the docs to know what FF
stands for)

On an AthlonXP 2400 (2000MHz) it achieves 165Mbit/s; the previous record
was around 20Mbit/s.

This means that:
- decrypting a 8Mbit/s stream takes 5% of CPU instead of 40%
- decrypting a full transponder (with all its channels or with a big
  HDTV stream) carrying 38Mbit/s takes 23% of CPU instead of 190%
  (>100%, so undecryptable in real time)
- a very slow processor can decrypt one channel with no problems
- offline decoding of one hour of a 5Mbit/s channel takes less than
  two minutes (30x than realtime)
- offline decoding will work at more than 20MB/s (megabytes/s),
  nearly as fast as a file copy
